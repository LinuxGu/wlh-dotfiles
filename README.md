## wlh-dotfiles
my dotfiles backup

Modified from some dotfiles I like. :)

I use both KDE and i3wm. (Now I mainly use DDE instead, but dotfiles about i3wm still works).
I hope it can help someone who would like to try i3wm.

### dependencies
- i3-gaps
- conky
- compton
- ttf-font-awesome

You need to install these packages to make my i3 dotfile work.
Hope you like it.
